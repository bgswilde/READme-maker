  ## Description
  This application uses JavaScript and Node to create a professional README markdown file. Utlizing node and js concepts like modules, template literals, and npm, this application will use prompts through the command line to get data to create the README file. In fact, aside from the video included in this file, this README was created using this README-maker application!
